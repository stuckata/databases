Transact-SQL (T-SQL)
====================
Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
