Hierarchical database model
===========================
The hierarchical database model is organized in a tree-like structure. The data records are connected to one another through links. Every record is a collection of fields and each field contain only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains. A record in hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in realtional database model and an entity type corresponds to a table(relation). The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records, also known as one-to-many relationships. In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node.

Pros
----
Widely used in applications that require very high performance and availability such as banking and telecommunications
Useful for storing geographic information and file systems

Cons
----
Difficult or impossible to extend the data model
Cannot force consistency between all logical entities
Leads to query bias. Certain types of queries are easier to write and execute faster than others
Could not describe well many-to-many or many-to-one relationship
