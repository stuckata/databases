What are the constraint types?
==============================
Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data.

primary key constraint
----------------------
Entity integrity concerns the concept of a primary key. Entity integrity is an integrity rule which states that every table must have a primary key and that the column or columns chosen to be the primary key should be unique and not null.

unique key constraint
---------------------
To ensure that two keys share a primary key to foreign key relationship

foreign key constraint
----------------------
Referential integrity concerns the concept of a foreign key. The referential integrity rule states that any foreign-key value can only be in one of two states. The usual state of affairs is that the foreign-key value refers to a primary key value of some table in the database. Occasionally, and this will depend on the rules of the data owner, a foreign-key value can be null. In this case we are explicitly saying that either there is no relationship between the objects represented in the database or that this relationship is unknown.

not null constraint
-------------------
To ensure that no null values are allowed

When are they used?
=================== 
Constraints verify that the data in the data warehouse conforms to a basic level of data consistency and correctness, preventing the introduction of dirty data. Having a single, well-controlled, and well-defined data-integrity system increases stability (one centralized system performs all data integrity operations), performance (all data integrity operations are performed in the same tier as the consistency model), re-usability (all applications benefit from a single centralized data integrity system), maintainability (one centralized system for all data integrity administration).
